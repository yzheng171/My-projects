The overall goal of my SQT program is to read student records from a file, and let the user enter queries to see a detail or summary report.

1st step:
I opened the txt file(student.txt), and then used pandas to transfer it into excel. 

2nd step:
Query 1: Use pandas to display all student records.

3rd step:
Query 2: Display students whose last name begins with a certain sting.
I used ‘lower()’ to convert all data in the ‘Last’ column and the strings that the user input to lowercase. The following result shows all the information of students whose last name begins with ‘s’.

4th step:
Query 3: Display all records for students whose graduating year is a certain year.
The following result shows all students who graduated in 2021.
